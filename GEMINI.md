# GEMINI.md

## Project Overview

This is a simple, single-page personal website for Shane Golding. It is a static website with no build process. The `index.html` file contains all the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website is configured to be served from the custom domain `shanegolding.net`.

The website features:
*   A particle animation background.
*   A typing animation for the name "Shane Golding".
*   An "About Me" section.
*   A "Projects" section, which includes an interactive Snake game.
*   A "Contact" section with a mailto link.

## Building and Running

This is a static website, so there is no build process. To run the website, you can open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Development Conventions

All of the code is contained within the `index.html` file.
*   The CSS is in a `<style>` block in the `<head>`.
*   The JavaScript is in a `<script>` block at the end of the `<body>`.

There are no external libraries used, except for Google Fonts. The JavaScript is written in plain ES6.
