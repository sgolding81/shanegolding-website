# Shane Golding's Personal Website

This is the source code for my personal website, hosted on GitHub Pages at [shanegolding.net](https://shanegolding.net).

## Project Structure

The website is built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The file structure is as follows:

*   `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the website.
*   `style.css`: The stylesheet that contains all the styles for the website.
*   `script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains all the interactive functionality, including the particle background and the Snake game.

## Code Overview

### HTML

The `index.html` file is organized into semantic sections, including a header, "About Me," "Projects," and "Contact." It also includes the canvas element for the particle background and the Snake game.

### CSS

The `style.css` file uses a dark theme with a vibrant green accent color. It includes styles for the overall layout, typography, animations, and the Snake game. The stylesheet also includes media queries for responsive design, ensuring the website looks good on different screen sizes.

### JavaScript

The `script.js` file is written in vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) and is not transpiled or bundled. It includes the following features:

*   **Particle Background:** A canvas-based animation of particles that float and connect to each other.
*   **Typing Effect:** A typing animation for the name "Shane Golding."
*   **Snake Game:** A complete implementation of the classic Snake game, with a scoreboard and touch controls for mobile devices.
